# dawsonspresentation

A small program to check what specials are on the menu and generate a slideshow accordingly.

How to run:
Simply run the file run.py with Python or run the start.sh shell script.

How it works:
The program uses Selenium to grab the daily specials items from the Dawson's Website. It then updates a powerpoint slide to show the current special items for the day.
